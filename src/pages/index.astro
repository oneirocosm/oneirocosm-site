      Hello! My name is Sylvie, and this is my website! Right now, it's mostly
      serving as a blog for various stuff that I feel like writing about, but in
      the future, who knows! Anyway, the site is still a work in progress, so
      some parts won't be working 100% properly yet&mdash;that said, it's
      starting to get there. Anyway, thanks for visiting! Odds are, if you are
      looking for something here, I've moved it to the [Articles](/articles/)
      section. I've also finally filled out the [About Me](/about/) and
      [Contact](/contact/) sections, so feel free to take a look at those as
      well!
